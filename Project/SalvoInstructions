You and the enemy each get 5 ships: an Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Patrol Boat, Submarine, and a
Destroyer. The goal is to find all of the enemy’s ships and destroy them before he destroys all of your
ships. The winner is the one who destroys all of their opponent’s ships. 

Salvo Mode: In this game mode, the amount of shots you are able to take per turn depends on the number of
ships that have not sunk on your grid. For example, when the game starts and you have 5
ships, you are able to shoot at 5 different spots on the opponent’s grid per turn. Once you lose a ship,
the number of shots you can take per turn will be reduced by 1.  You do not get an extra turn when an
enemy ship is hit.
