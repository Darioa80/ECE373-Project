You and the enemy each get 5 ships: an Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Patrol Boat, Submarine, and a 
Destroyer. The goal is to find all of the enemy’s ships and destroy them before he destroys all of your 
ships. The winner is the one who destroys all of their opponent’s ships. 
Classic Mode: The game is played in turns. In each turn, you have the opportunity to select a point on 
the grid to shoot. If an enemy ship is occupying the selected spot, you get to go again and the location
you selected turns red. If the spot is empty, the location turns white and it’s the enemy’s turn. The first 
to sink all the ships on the opponent’s grid wins the game!
